=============
LCARS Roadmap
=============

[updated February 14, 2017]

Long-term 
=========

Add epistemological guidance the GUI.
  Dashboard: Be Attentive
  Analysis: Be Reasonable
  Threat Intelligence: Be Intelligent
  Reconfigurator: Be Responsible

Implement an API honeypot.
  The G* API attracted a lot of unwanted attention when it was deployed on AWS.
  We could do something similar (or the same) and collect the data.

Unify the Reconfigurator Log with the overall LCARS log.
Then delete the Reconfigurator Log and use that space for Firewall State. 

Increase the LCARS log attentiveness. (Log more activity)

Begin implementing automation with a manual "trigger" action for attack profiles that...
  -- notes the start (current) time
  -- generates a unique id for this action
  -- deploys the orchestrated response 
  -- notes the finish time (when the response has been fully deployed)
  -- logs everything with that id


Short-term 
==========

Dashboard
---------
- make the "Top 5" chart real
- make the "Attack Origins" world map real (and rename)
- rename "Honeypot Classifiers" to "Longtail Activity"


Analysis
--------
- rename "Log Data" to "Logs"
- rename the "Honeypot" tab to "Longtail"
- add a tab for "LCARS" logs
   -- populate it with daily snapshots of the LCARS log
   -- enhance our parser to make it into analyzable JSON
- default "show link weights" to on in Hive Plots


Threat Intelligence
-------------------
- add ability to specify REST requests to a BlackRidge device in response recipe details


Reconfigurator
--------------
- add ability to send REST requests to a BlackRidge device and test extensively


System Monitoring
-----------------
- use a cooler font for the LCARS log
- rename "Iptables" to "iptables"

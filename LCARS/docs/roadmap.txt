=============
LCARS Roadmap
=============

[updated February 15, 2017]

Long-term 
=========

Implement an API honeypot called GRAPH: G* Realistic Application Programming Handler
  The G* API attracted a lot of unwanted attention when it was deployed on AWS.
  We could do something similar (or the same), collect the data, log it, and analyze it with LCARS.

Continue to research and prototype Machine Learning techniques for log analysis in this context.

Begin implementing an automated "Threat Eliminator" with a manual "trigger" action for attack profiles that...
  -- notes the start (current) time
  -- generates a unique id for this action
  -- deploys the orchestrated response 
  -- notes the finish time (when the response has been fully deployed)
  -- logs everything with that id

Enhance LCARS with a
Universal Log TRanslator And Parser with Intermediate Management and Profiling"
  -- input from many sources (Graylog, Longtail, Dolos, GRAPH, SDN controllers, BlackRidge Gateways, others)
  -- ETL-like format standardization
  -- enrich in many ways (geo-tags, pre-calculations, summaries, meta-data, etc.)



Short-term 
==========

General
-------
Add epistemological guidance the GUI.
  Dashboard: Be Attentive
  Analysis: Be Reasonable
  Threat Intelligence: Be Intelligent
  Reconfigurator: Be Responsible


Dashboard
---------
- make the "Top 5" chart real
- make the "Attack Origins" world map real (and rename)
- rename "Honeypot Classifiers" to "Longtail Activity"


Analysis
--------
- continue work on ML (see above)
- add a tab for "LCARS" logs
   -- populate it with daily snapshots of the LCARS log
   -- enhance our parser to make it into analyzable JSON
- default "show link weights" to ON in Hive Plots


Threat Intelligence
-------------------
- add ability to specify REST requests to a BlackRidge device in response recipe details


Reconfigurator
--------------
- develop a test environment to test integration with...
  -- BlackRidge
  -- virtual routers
  -- SDN controller
  -- other firewalls
  ... all of which need to be set up in a test environment we control
- add ability to send REST requests to a BlackRidge device and test extensively


System Monitoring
-----------------
- Use a cooler font for the LCARS log.
- Rename "Iptables" to "iptables".
- Unify the Reconfigurator Log with the overall LCARS log. Then delete the Reconfigurator Log and use that space for Firewall State. 
-  Increase the LCARS log attentiveness. (Log more activity)
